# LLM-Project
In this project, ChatGPT is asked what life is like in every country. Then using sentiment analysis, we see ChatGPT's opinion about each country based on the amount of positive and negative words used in response to the prompt. An image is attached that shows a world map color coded based on ChatGPT sentiment.
